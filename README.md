# Surfs Up
## Overview of the Analysis 

A client is looking to open a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii, and would like analysis done on temperature data from the months of June and December in Oahu to present to funders and make a case for his business. 

## Results

* The average temperature in June is 75 degrees Fahrenheit. The average temperature in December is 71 degrees Fahrenheit.
* The minimum temperature in June is 64 degrees Fahrenheit. The minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees Fahrenheit.
* The maximum temperature in June is 85 degrees Fahrenheit. The maximum temperature in December is 83 degrees Fahrenheit.

## Summary

Considering the data for June, which consisted of 1700 data points, and December, which consisted of 1517 datapoints, I would recommend that the months of June and December are good months for the surf and ice cream shop to be open, with both months having average temperatures in the seventies. There may be a few days in December that will be too cold, and even fewer in June. I don't think this dataset is complete without precipitation information. Even if the weather is warmer, heavy periods of rain will deter tourists and locals alike from getting ice cream and surfing on those days. I would also go deeper into the temperautre data, and find out exactly how many days were below 60 degrees Fahrenheit in June and December.
